# Drawing application

This is a project from the online bootcamp 'The Odin Project' :

https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project

Here, I had to create a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

This was a very good opportunity to practice my recent DOM manipulation skills.

The project wasn't easy, but made me learn a lot of JavaScript methods.

I also had a lot of fun with making a cool design in CSS.
